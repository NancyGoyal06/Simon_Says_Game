## üß† About the Game

**Simon Says** is a classic memory game where the player must repeat an ever-growing sequence of colors in the correct order. This version is a modern, web-based take on the original game.

Built entirely with vanilla **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**, it mimics the iconic gameplay while adding a clean UI, subtle animations, and responsive design. The game begins with a single color flash, and with each correct response, the level increases and the sequence grows more challenging.

This project is great for:
- Practicing **DOM manipulation**
- Understanding **event handling** and **user interaction**
- Learning how to build a **stateful browser game**
- Building strong fundamentals in front-end web development

It‚Äôs lightweight, fast, and perfect for quick memory training sessions or as a beginner coding challenge.
